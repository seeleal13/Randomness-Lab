i made **Randomness Lab** to be an interactive, educational website that showcases
different types of Random Number Generators (RNGs) but also in fun way! a win-win situation hehe
note that i tried not to dive a lot into "what's behind" science so you can appreciate it in peace ToT
 well, It lets you explore, visualize, and compare how algorithms like **Linear
Congruential Generator (LCG)**, **Xorshift**, **Middle Square**,
**Multiplicative Congruential**, and browser **Crypto RNG** behave,
with graphs, statistics, and entropy demonstrations.

##  Features 

-   **Interactive Generators**
    -   Pseudo-Random (LCG) with seed control\
    -   Cryptographically Secure RNG (`window.crypto`)
    -   Physical RNG (mouse movement / touch gestures)
    -   Advanced RNGs: Xorshift, Middle Square, Multiplicative
        Congruential
-   **Visualizations**
    -   line charts using HTML5 Canvas
    -   Statistics: current value, count, average, entropy/cycle
        detection
-   **Educational Comparisons**
    -   Pros, cons, use cases, and historical notes for each RNG
    -   Side-by-side comparisons of algorithms
-   **Accessible Implementation**
    -   Built with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
    -   No external dependencies so it runs directly in the browser XD

##  Project Structure

    index.html   # Main single-page website

Everything is contained in **`index.html`**. Just open it in any modern
browser to explore.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

##  how to try ?

1.  Open `index.html` in your browser.
    That's it! No build steps or installations required.
    
2.  or click simply the link next to the repo decription

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##  Motivation

This project is meant to **educate** others about how computers generate
random numbers, their limitations, and why understanding randomness is
important.
